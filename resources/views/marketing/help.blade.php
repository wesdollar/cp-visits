                <h2>What is a list?</h2>
                <p>
                    Think of a list as your visitation list. Add anyone that could use a visit to this list. You are free to create or subscribe to as many lists as you would like. For example, you could have a visitation list for your church Sunday school class. You could then create a second list to help you keep track of the people in your choir that may be sick or in the hospital.
                </p>

                <h2>What is a Visitee?</h2>
                <p>
                    Visitees are the people on your visitation list. If there's someone you know needs a visit, add them to your list so you won't forget to visit them. If you're a member of a group or social club, you can share the list with other members so they can go visit these people, too.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I create a list?</h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a list is simple. To create a list:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the navigation menu by clicking the "hamburger" icon.</li>
                    <li>Select "Lists"</li>
                    <li>A new list can be create by either (a) clicking on the "plus" icon in the top, right-hand corner or by clicking on "Create a List" below the list of lists you are currently subscribed to.</li>
                    <li>Provide the information for your new lists and click "Create List"</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How do I share a list?</h2>
                <p>
                    We've done our best to make inviting others to subscribe to your visitation list as easy as possible. To invite someone to subscribe to your list, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the navigation menu by clicking the "hamburger" icon.</li>
                    <li>Select "Lists"</li>
                    <li>Click on the list you would like to share.</li>
                    <li>Click "Share List"</li>
                    <li>Provide the email address of each people you would like to share the list with.</li>
                    <li>Click "Send Invite"</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Each person who's email address you have provided will receive an email with further instructions on how to subscribe to your list. All they have to do upon receiving the email is click the link within and either login if they already have an account or create an account if this is their first time using the app. They will automatically be subscribed to the list you have shared.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I add a Visitee?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you haven't previously created a list or subscribed to an existing list, you'll need to do so before creating a Visitee — all Visitees must belong to a list. Once you have a visitation list, follow these steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the navigation menu by clicking the "hamburger" icon.</li>
                    <li>Select "Visitees"</li>
                    <li>A new Visitee can be create by either (a) clicking on the "plus" icon in the top, right-hand corner or by clicking on "Add Visitee" below the list of current Visitees.</li>
                    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions as you provide the Visitees information.</li>
                    <li>Once you've added all of the information you wish to provide, simply click "Add Visitee"</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What is a Check In?</h2>
                <p>
                    Though it isn't required, we recommend that you check in when visiting anyone on your visitation list(s). This allows the other people that are subscribe to your list to see that someone has recently visited this person. Each time you check in, you will be able to leave a note about your visit and optionally include a photo if you would like. This is a great way to let others know how the person you are visiting is doing.
                </p>

                <h2>Can anyone view my visitation list?</h2>
                <p>
                    Absolutely not! We've made it easy for people to find your visitation list by simply searching for the name of your list. At this point, all they can see, though, is the name of the visitation list. They can request to subscribe to the list but will not be subscribed until the owner of the list approves of that person subscribing to the list.
                </p>

                <h2>How do you protect the private information of the people on the visitation list?</h2>
                <p>
                    All of the information for each person is kept securely on our servers. We encrypt the data itself and the transmission of the data. Only people who have been authorized by the owner of the visitation list are able to see the people on the list. All users of the Visit app must create an account to use the app and subscribe to visitation lists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We take privacy and security very, very seriously. We take all measures possible to secure all data.
                </p>

                <h2>Do you sell any of the information you collect via the app?</h2>
                <p>
                    Absolutely not! We will never sell any of the information we collect to any party.
                </p>
